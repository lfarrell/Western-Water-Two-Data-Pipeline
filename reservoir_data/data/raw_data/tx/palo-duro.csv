#     conservation_capacity = storage at conservation pool elevation - dead pool capacity
#     conservation_storage = reservoir storage - dead pool capacity (note: conservation storage is capped at conservation capacity)

# Footnote:
#     
# 
#             The elevation-storage rating curve used to produce the storage
#             hydrograph is made of two segments: (1) the segment up to the
#             conservation pool top (below the red line) is based on measured data,
#              and (2) the segment in the flood pool (above the red line) is an
#             extrapolation from the first segment and shouldn't be relied upon for
#             flood storage information.
#         
# 
# Data from 2021-01-13 06:00:00 to 2021-07-03 18:45:00 is marked as provisional by the USGS.

# 
#             The elevation-storage rating curve used to produce the storage
#             hydrograph is made of two segments: (1) the segment up to the
#             conservation pool top (below the red line) is based on measured data,
#              and (2) the segment in the flood pool (above the red line) is an
#             extrapolation from the first segment and shouldn't be relied upon for
#             flood storage information.
#

# Data from 2021-03-01 06:00:00 to 2021-07-03 19:00:00 is marked as provisional by the USGS.
